# ACSE-4-SPH

[Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) (SPH) is a meshless
method for solving the Navier-Stokes equation, in which fluid properties are stored on Lagrangian fluid particles (i.e. on
particles which move with the fluid flow). The particles interact to generate values across the entire fluid domain through
continuous smoothing kernels. 

As the SPH method is meshless and Lagrangian, it is ideal for solving problems involving fluid flow with interfaces and free 
surfaces. This tool implements the SPH method in C++ to solve wave generation in a lock-release/dam-break problem.

### Compilation/Installation Guide

To install the project, simply run this in your favorite terminal:

``` ```

### User instructions

*To be written*

### Documentation

The code includes [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation. On systems with Sphinx installed, this can be built by running

```
python -m sphinx docs html
```

then viewing the `index.html` file in the `html` directory in your browser.

For systems with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) installed, a manual pdf can be generated by running

```
python -m sphinx  -b latex docs latex
```

Then following the instructions to process the `.tex` file in the `latex` directory in your browser.

### Testing

The tool includes tests, which you can use to check its operation on your system. With the code compiled, these can be run 
with

```
make runtests
```
